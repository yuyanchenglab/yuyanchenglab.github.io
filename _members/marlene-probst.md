Marlene is a PhD student in Cell and Molecular Biology at Penn in the
Gene Therapy and Vaccines subprogram. Marlene received their B.S. in
Neuroscience from the University of Washington in 2022. As an
undergraduate and post-baccalaureate researcher they worked in the lab
of Dr. Thomas Reh where they researched AAV-mediated gene therapy
approaches to reprogram Müller glia into retinal neurons. As a graduate
student in the Cheng lab, Marlene will investigate genetic regulation
after optic nerve injury using CRISPR screens and single-cell genomics.
Additionally, they are collaborating on projects to design and screen
LNPs for retinal gene therapy delivery. Outside of the lab Marlene
enjoys biking around Philly, grave gardening, and crafting.
