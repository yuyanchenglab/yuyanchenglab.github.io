Cass graduated with Honors bachelorâ€™s degrees in Biology and English at the University of Delaware in May 2024. During her undergraduate years, she cultivated a strong background in both clinical ophthalmology and molecular biology research in the Pennsylvania-Delaware area. Today, she is assisting the Cheng lab with ocular nerve damage gene therapeutic projects through mouse model studies. Cass plans to use her research field experience and passion for service to continue her path in ophthalmology as a future medical professional. Outside of work and studies, she enjoys gaming and writing. A Delawarean at heart, Cass also loves to explore the East Coast through travels with friends and family.
