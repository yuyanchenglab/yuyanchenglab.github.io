Cass graduated with Honors bachelor’s degrees in Biology and English at the University of Delaware in May 2024. During her undergraduate years, she cultivated a strong background in both clinical ophthalmology and molecular biology research in the Pennsylvania-Delaware area. Today, she is assisting the Cheng lab with ocular nerve damage gene therapeutic projects through mouse model studies. Outside of work and studies, she enjoys hiking, rock climbing, and writing. A Delawarean at heart, Cass also loves to explore the East Coast through travels with friends and family.
