Malthus came to prominence for his 1798 publication, An Essay on the Principle of Population. He wrote the original text in reaction to the optimism of his father and his father's associates (notably Jean-Jacques Rousseau) regarding the future improvement of society.

Germ plasm (German: Keimplasma) is a biological concept developed in the 19th century by the German biologist August Weismann. It states that heritable information is transmitted only by germ cells in the gonads (ovaries and testes), not by somatic cells. The related idea that information cannot pass from somatic cells to the germ line, contrary to Lamarckism, is called the Weismann barrier. To some extent this theory anticipated the development of modern genetics. 

The term Keimplasma (germ plasm) was first used by the German biologist, August Weismann (1834–1914), and described in his 1892 book Das Keimplasma: eine Theorie der Vererbung (The Germ Plasm: a theory of inheritance).[1] His theory states that multicellular organisms consist of germ cells that contain and transmit heritable information, and somatic cells which carry out ordinary bodily functions.

Pearson's relativity was based on idealism, in the sense of ideas or pictures in a mind. "There are many signs", he wrote, "that a sound idealism is surely replacing, as a basis for natural philosophy, the crude materialism of the older physicists." (Preface to second Ed., The Grammar of Science) Further, he stated, "... science is in reality a classification and analysis of the contents of the mind ... In truth, the field of science is much more consciousness than an external world." (Ibid., Ch. II, § 6) "Law in the scientific sense is thus essentially a product of the human mind and has no meaning apart from man." (Ibid., Ch. III, § 4)[21]

In the first place, we must definitely free our minds, in the present state of our knowledge of the mechanism of inheritance and reproduction, of any hope of reaching a mathematical relation expressing the degree of correlation between individual parent and individual offspring. The causes in any individual case of inheritance are far too complex to admit of exact treatment; and up to the present the classification of the circumstances under which greater or less degrees of correlation between special groups of parents and offspring may be expected has made but little progress. This is largely owing to a certain prevalence of almost metaphysical speculation as to the causes of heredity, which has usurped the place of that careful collection and elaborate experiment by which alone sufficient data might have been accumulated, with a view to ultimately narrowing and specialising the circumstances under which correlation was measured. We must proceed from inheritance in the mass to inheritance in narrower and narrwoer classes, rather than attempt to build up general rules on the observation of individual instances. Shortly, we must proceed by the method of statistics, rather than by the consideration of typical cases.

"It is only in very recent times that it has begun to dawn upon the mind of man that there is another world only one degree less complex and wonderful than the stellar universe,--the world of molecules and atoms."

"While it is never safe to affirm that the future of Physical Science has no marvels in store even more astonishing than those of the past, it seems probable that most of the grand underlying principles have been firmly established and that further advances are to be sought chiefly in the rigorous application of these principles to all the phenomena which come under our notice. It is here that the science of measurement shows its importance — where quantitative work is more to be desired than qualitative work. An eminent physicist remarked that the future truths of physical science are to be looked for in the sixth place of decimals."

Dr. Pasteur passed away in 1895, and
```

This is a quote from University of Chicago's head of physics in 1896. It is often misattributed to Lord Kelvin and jeered for its apparent lack foresight. The year prior had been full of groundbreaking discoveries that could have seemed to be the end of "obvious" science. Dr. Wilhelm Rontgen's new X-rays could scan the human body's internals. On the other end of the spectrum, Guglielmo Marconi was calibrating radio waves to transmit signals wirelessly. Chemist Dr. Svante Arrhenius publishes the first scientific paper on greenhouse gas emissions. Dr. Michelson was right to start off with a disclaimer allowing for unknown unknowns in the future of scientific discovery. In the decade after this statement a couple paradigm shifting discoveries occured: the anatomy of the atom (Rutherford, 1911), Einstein's photoelectric effect (1905), and the transistor (Lieben, 1906). But the precision of scientific work is what lead to these discoveries becoming useful. The precise manipulation of fissile nuclei to create a bomb, measuring the excitation of millions of photosensors for digital photography and the miniaturization of controllable semiconductor gates to bring Charles Babbage's theoretical Analytical Engine to life. 

`Refer to spatial transcriptomics more in the examples`

So yes, the first part of his statement is wrong. There are still marvels ahead of him to discover, some that I have already listed. I would be uncomfortable to make such a statement even today, over a century later. But the latter part of his statement is one that I can confidently endorse. Though many of his direct colleagues would agree on the importance of precise tools of measurement (insofar as his rhetoric successfully sways sources of funding), the field of biology was averse to such a suggestion.

The suggestion that the mechanisms of biology could be reduced to or analyzed with non-biological principles is hard to internalize, even in our age. Louis Pasteur in 1859 used a sterilized setup of flasks to disprove spontaneous generation, the idea that life such as maggots can spontaneously appear from non-living matter. "Never will the doctrine of spontaneous generation recover from the mortal blow of this simple experiment. There is no known circumstance in which it can be confirmed that microscopic beings came into the world without germs, without parents similar to themselves (Pasteur won the Alhumbert Prize in 1862)." The final phrase belying Dr. Pasteur's philosophy and the other definition of 'germ,' referring to heredity from parent to child. An unbroken chain from the beginning until the present. But such a description of history is incompatible with the idea that living and non-living matter are identical and can be explained identically. Dr. Pasteur took stock in "vitalism," the belief that living and non-living matter are fundamentally different in some way. It makes sense that he'd want to disprove that fleas can spontaneously form from dust. They are obviously too complex to assume form without guidance, much as a watch found in the woods must have been produced by an unknown watchmaker!

This belief that living and non-living sciences are fundamentally different is old and limped into the new century where its influence on biology research died (The Nature of Life: Classical and Contemporary Perspectives from Philosophy, Ernst Mayr, Chapter 6, "What is the meaning of life"). One of its pole-bearers was Dr. Karl Pearson. In 1896, he was working on his eponymous correlations to support the theory of evolution. He published an 18 part series called "Mathematical Contributions to the Theory of Evolution" where he endorsed the important "quantitative work" that Dr. Michelson described.

"The confidence I put in the truth of the law is not measured by
Mr. Galton’s researches on stature or on colour in Basset hounds,
however strong evidence these may provide, but rather on the fact
that **the theory gives a priori** the correlation between parents and
offspring, and that this correlation is practically identical with the
value I have myself determined from these and other observations."
- Dr. Karl Pearson. "Mathematical contributions to the theory of evolution. On the Law of Ancestral Heredity" (1898)

Pearson continued his advocacy by establishing a journal devoted to statistics applied to biology named Biometrika in 1902. Less than a century later, this field of biometrics spawned a new subfield devoted to the study of incredibly large and often discrete biological data called bioinformatics. The precise control and measurements of electrons by the transistor allow us to automagically handle incredible amounts of biological information, apply statistical analysis to it in a reasonable time and condense it into meaningful insights. In my career, I've experienced the progression from bulk RNA-seq to measure the average expression of cells in tissues to single cell RNA-seq to measure the expression of individual cells from a tissue. Now we take a step from the 5th to the 6th decimal place as we measure the individual expression of cells within a tissue with Xenium.
