January 2025: Nikhil Jaglan and Rushil Patel joined the lab.  

Nikhil is a rising Penn junior on the pre-medicine track bridging mathematics, healthcare, and business. In lab, he works on genotyping, immunohistochemistry, and other wet-lab techniques.

Rushil is a rising Penn sophomore studying computer science. His work in lab is analytical, using single-cell data to improve cell clustering methods and search for genetic markers for cells and disease conditions through retina, optic nerve and brain cells.

March 2025: Yuyan and Dr. Qi Cui were awarded a pilot grant from American Glaucoma Society to support our glaucoma omics work!

May 2025: Michael Ramirez joined the lab for summer research. He is a rising Penn sophomore studying computer science. His current work in the lab involves optimizing computer vision algorithms for cell segmentation. 

May 2025: Kelly attended the 2025 ARVO conference, where she presented her work on the LNP project investigating the temporal and spatial distribution of LNP expression across the retina.

Gaby’s poster highlighted progress on the single-nucleus atlas of healthy and glaucomatous retina and optic nerve tissues from a mouse model of glaucoma.

Cass presented on her nuclei extraction optimization for murine retinal tissues to maximize nuclei yield and inherently obtain higher-quality gene reads.

June 2025: Rushil was awarded the CURF $5,000 Summer Research Funding grant to continue his research on spatial transcriptomics! 

June 2025: Yuyan is selected as the NIA Butler-Williams Scholar and as a member of the NIH Early Career Reviewer Program! 

July 2025: Marlene Probst joined the lab as a rotation student. Marlene is a Penn PhD student in Cell and Molecular Biology in the Gene Therapy and Vaccines subprogram. She will work on the LNP-CRISPR screen project for gene therapy targeting vision disorders.
